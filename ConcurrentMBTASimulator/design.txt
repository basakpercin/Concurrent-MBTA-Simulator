In this Project, I have created Threads of Trains and Passengers and
created a StationState class to keep track of the states of stations, and
methods for synchronizing threads with await and signalAll, maintaining
conditions of station availability and whether a train has arrived or not
and when it departed, await and signalAll is used for knowing if a train
has arrived at the station, and if a train has departed the station.
For passengers, it signals when a train arrives including if a train
is at the station and for trains, it signals when the next station
becomes available. In MBTA, I populate hashmaps for passengers and
their journeys, trains and their lines. The methods in MBTA includes
checking the train at a station is the right train for the passengers
to board and I thought of MBTA class as the controller of TrainThread,
PassengerThread, and StationState, it makes these 3 classes to work in
harmony. When all the passengers reach their destination and no passengers
are left in stations, the simulation should stop.
